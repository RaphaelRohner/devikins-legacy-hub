/**
 * HelpAssistant.js
 *
 * "Devi" - a tiny, entirely offline, definitely-not-a-real-AI helper
 * built into the app. Its origin is exactly what it sounds like: asked
 * (as a joke) for "a downgraded version of you" inside the app, so this
 * is that - a chat-shaped screen that matches whatever you type against
 * a small, fixed list of canned answers about using THIS app (adding a
 * wallet, what Fetch/Update does, filters, ratings, feedback, etc.).
 * There's no language model here, no network call, no API key, nothing
 * that costs money or needs a backend - just keyword matching against
 * FAQ_ENTRIES below (see matchEntry/scoreEntry further down - it's a
 * little smarter than plain substring matching: it tolerates small
 * typos and simple word variations, e.g. "walet"/"wallets" both still
 * find the wallet answer, without needing an exact keyword substring).
 * A real AI chat (calling an actual LLM API) would need a backend
 * server to hold the API key safely and would cost real money per
 * message - a genuinely different, bigger project than this, and not
 * what this screen is (asked about directly, and kept as a free,
 * offline FAQ on purpose - see NOTES.md).
 *
 * Devi is upfront about all of this the moment you open the screen and
 * whenever it can't match your question - it should never come across
 * as more capable than it actually is.
 *
 * Every FAQ_ENTRIES question/answer pair is shown as a plain, always-
 * visible list - each answer stacked directly under its own question,
 * one after another - rather than hidden behind tappable chips you'd
 * have to try one at a time to see what's there. The free-text input at
 * the bottom still exists for anything not already covered, and typed
 * questions get their own answer appended below the list as a small
 * chat exchange.
 *
 * As the list grew past a dozen entries, a single flat list of
 * questions started reading as unstructured - no way to tell at a
 * glance what was covered without reading every question. Grouped now
 * under a handful of topic headings (see FAQ_TOPICS, right above
 * FAQ_ENTRIES) - Wallets & wallet sets, Browsing & organizing your
 * collection, When something looks off, Other tools, and Data,
 * feedback & about Devi. Purely a display grouping: the free-text
 * matching below still searches every entry regardless of topic, so
 * this doesn't change what typing a question finds.
 *
 * Same full-screen-takeover pattern as WalletManager.js/Feedback.js -
 * this is App.js's seventh "screen" (`currentScreen === 'help'`), opened
 * from the hamburger menu, with its own small round "‹" back button in
 * the top-left corner (see Feedback.js's file comment - all four of
 * these screens' back buttons were shortened from "‹ Back to Home" to
 * just the arrow, per feedback).

Handy if two people share the app (each gets their own set), or if you want to peek at a friend's collection without mixing it into your own.

Import (also on the Wallets screen) reads one of those zip files back in as a new set. Every file it writes is checked against the zip's own checksum afterward, so you'll be warned if anything didn't come through intact. While an export or import is running, everything else on the Wallets screen - switching sets, adding or editing wallets, Delete, Reset All Data, even leaving the screen - is locked until it finishes, since those all touch the same files the export or import is actively working with.",

The first fetch takes the longest since nothing's cached yet - after that, it's much faster.

    answer:
      "That's what lets a Fetch/Update keep going even if you switch to another app, lock your phone, or close the app entirely by swiping it away from Recents - confirmed on a real device, a big fetch keeps right on running and the notification keeps updating with live progress, so you're free to walk away or browse elsewhere instead of having to sit and watch it finish. It clears itself automatically the moment the fetch finishes, is cancelled, or hits an error - it isn't something you need to tap or dismiss yourself. One thing that never changes: only a fetch you actually started keeps going this way - the app never wakes itself up or starts a fetch on its own, closed or not. If you decline the notification permission, Fetch/Update still works exactly the same, it just won't be protected if you leave the app for a long stretch.",

      "It's a personal organizing flag only - nothing is removed from the blockchain, or even from this app's own database. It greys the item out (or hides it entirely if you switch on the Deleted filter) so your list stays tidy, and you can tap Restore on it any time. One thing to know: if you still hold the NFT, the next Fetch/Update will automatically un-delete it, since successfully re-fetching it is proof you still own it.",

      "The search bar at the top matches an NFT's name, your own custom nickname for it, or its ID, and narrows the list as you type. The star Rating filter lives in Filters (tap Filters) - tap a star and every star up to it lights up, then tap Apply Filters to narrow the list to items rated EXACTLY that many stars (not 'that many or more'); tap the same star again, then Apply, to clear it.

    answer:
      "Sort picks one thing to order the whole list by - tap the sort button (e.g. ID or Rarity) and pick a field, and it applies the moment you tap it, no Apply needed. It never removes anything, just changes the order everything shows up in. Filters work differently because you're usually setting up more than one at a time (say, Rarity AND Ancestry AND a star rating together) - so picking them stays separate from actually narrowing the list, which is why Filters needs its own Apply Filters tap and Sort doesn't. Filters also remembers what you last picked, so reopening it lets you add, change, or remove any of your picks - narrowing further, loosening up, or swapping one for another - without starting over. Search, Sort, and Filters all work together at once - with a big collection, combining them (say, filter to one Rarity, sort those by Ancestry, then search by name) is usually the fastest way to find one specific NFT.",

    answer:
      "Devikins have 21 filterable traits, so on that tab Filters groups them to stay scannable: Rating, Rarity, Ancestry, Personality, Life Stage, and Procreations Left are always visible, and the rest sit inside three tappable sections - Genes, Affinities, and Attributes - each closed until you tap its name to open it. Picking a filter inside a closed section still works fine even if you leave it closed afterward; you just need to open a section once to reach the filters inside it. Weapons and Equipment aren't grouped this way yet - their filters are still one plain list.",

      "Open its detail view - right above the Notes section you'll find a Name field with a Save Name button, and a row of 5 stars. Type a name and tap Save Name to save it. Tap a star to rate it - once you have, a Clear Rating button appears right below the stars to un-rate it again (tapping the same star a second time does the same thing).",

    answer:
      "Open any item's detail view and, if the app has ever caught a real change on it, a floating Changelog button appears bottom-right. Tap it for a simple list of every change, newest first, grouped by when it was caught. This only tracks actual trait changes seen during a fetch (old value → new value) - not everything about the item, and not a change to something it never had a value for before. Weapon Durability is deliberately left out, since it shifts constantly during normal play and isn't meaningful history. An item with no logged changes yet just won't show the button at all.",

      "Open the ☰ menu and tap Kleverscan for a small built-in browser pointed straight at the Devikins collection's Holders list on kleverscan.org, Klever's own block explorer - no typing in a search box needed. Handy for checking who's holding what, and it's also a good way to find your own wallet address if you don't have it handy: if you know roughly how many Devikins you hold, you can browse the holder list and spot yourself.",

    answer:
      "Open the ☰ menu and tap KLV Signer (test) to send KLV, tokens or NFTs on Klever's testnet - the practice network, where nothing has real value. It needs the separate KLV Signer app on your phone: Devikins Legacy Hub never holds your wallet's private key. Tap Connect KLV Signer once (the Signer asks whether to allow the Hub), then enter a receiver and an amount and tap Send with KLV Signer. The Signer shows you exactly what will be sent and only signs after you enter your Signer password; the Hub then sends it to the testnet and gives you a Kleverscan link. Before every request the Hub checks with Android that the Signer on your phone is the official one (by its seal, the signing certificate); a fake app pretending to be the Signer gets nothing. It's testnet-only for now because the Signer is still being tested - sending your real Devikins will come later.",

      "Open the ☰ menu and tap Breeding Helper for a two-step finder for breeding partners among your own Devikins. Step 1 narrows your collection by Rarity, Ancestry, Procreations Left, and optionally up to two Target Affinities - tap a result to pick it as your starting Devikin. Step 2 then lists every other Devikin that's actually a match: same Rarity always, and by default the same Procreations Left too (turn on \"Allow +/-1\" if you need a bit more room there), ranked by how well they match your chosen Affinities, with an estimated breeding cost and the offspring's resulting Procreations Left. One thing it can't do: tell you whether two Devikins are actually related - there's no parent/lineage data anywhere in the game's own data, so that check is still on you, same as in the game itself.",

      "Tap the ⇄ Compare button next to List/Tiles on any collection tab. While it's on, tapping an item selects it (up to two, highlighted with a colored border) instead of opening its detail view - pick a second item of the same kind and it opens straight into a full side-by-side listing of every one of its stats. \"Show differences only\" hides anything the two agree on, handy when you're just deciding which one to keep.

      "The game's own metadata service occasionally times out or has no data for an item yet. 'Fetch failed' items get another try the next time you tap Fetch/Update (there's no automatic background retry, so it won't fix itself on its own); 'Unavailable' means the service gave a clear 'this doesn't exist' answer, so it's treated as final and isn't retried even then.",

It can't be undone, though your real NFTs on the blockchain are never touched. For just one set gone wrong, its own Delete button (next to it in the wallet-set switcher, near the top of the same screen) is the gentler option - it only erases that one set, leaving the rest of your sets untouched.",

      "Yes, while the app is open - it quietly checks for anything left over ('Fetch failed' items, or items missing a cached image) and retries just those, on its own, without you needing to tap Fetch/Update. It checks right when you open the app and whenever you come back to it, then keeps checking about once a minute for a while, backing off to about once an hour once everything's caught up. It won't run in the background once the app is fully closed, and it never fetches anything genuinely new on its own - only cleaning up items that already failed.",
