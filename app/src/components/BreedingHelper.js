/**
 * BreedingHelper.js
 *
 * A guided, two-step screen for finding a good breeding partner among
 * your own Devikins. This is App.js's eighth "screen" (see App.js's own
 * file comment for the pattern - `currentScreen === 'breeding'`), opened
 * from the hamburger menu, with the same full-screen-takeover shape and
 * small round "‹" back button every other menu screen uses (Wallets/
 * Feedback/Devi).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHAT IT CAN'T DO: there's no official documentation
 * of Devikins breeding strategy - the game's own guide pages cover
 * eligibility (not immediate relatives, max 10 procreations per Devikin,
 * Eldritch can't breed at all - it's one of the breeding *goals*, kept
 * rare on purpose) and the mechanical bits (incubator type controls the
 * offspring's Rarity cap; genes "blend" with a small mutation chance;
 * Ancestry comes from "one of the parents") but nothing about which
 * PAIRINGS are actually worth attempting. That part comes entirely from
 * Raphael's own breeding experience (roughly 2,000 procreations done):
 *
 *   1. Always breed the exact same Rarity - anything else is a waste.
 *      No exception to this one, ever.
 *   2. Always breed the exact same Procreations Left - anything else
 *      is a waste. There IS a real, sometimes-necessary exception here
 *      though: a mismatched pair (say 10 left with 6 left) still
 *      breeds fine in-game, it's just priced off whichever parent has
 *      FEWER Procreations Left, and the offspring's own Procreations
 *      Left is (that lower number) - 1. The "Allow +/-1 Procreations
 *      Left" toggle below widens Step 2's matches to include partners
 *      one off from the selected Devikin's own count, for exactly
 *      those times - it's opt-in and off by default, since an exact
 *      match is still the better outcome whenever one's available.
 *   3. Genes are basically random - there's no way to steer them, so
 *      this screen doesn't try to filter or score by them.
 *   4. To raise your odds of specific Affinities in the offspring, pair
 *      two Devikins that are BOTH strong in the same Affinity (1-10, 10
 *      is best) - and this can be done for up to two Affinities at
 *      once, since the real case is breeding for a specific pair
 *      together (Agility for turn order, Power for damage, say - see
 *      the "Target Affinities" control below, capped at two).
 *   5. The breeding cost is exponential: it starts from a base amount
 *      set by Rarity (Common 300, Uncommon 400, Rare 500, Mythic 600 -
 *      all at a full 10 Procreations Left) and doubles for every
 *      procreation already used - see src/constants/breedingRules.js
 *      for the actual numbers and estimateBreedingCost, which Step 2
 *      uses to show each candidate's estimated cost and the resulting
 *      offspring's Procreations Left.
 *
 * THE ONE THING THIS SCREEN CANNOT DO, EVER: tell you whether two
 * Devikins are actually related (parent, sibling, offspring). No
 * lineage/parent data exists anywhere in this app's metadata source -
 * confirmed against every known trait in src/constants/schema.js. That
 * check is still entirely on you, exactly like it is in the game
 * itself today (this is called out on-screen, prominently, in Step 2 -
 * see the disclaimer banner below). If the game or its records ever
 * become more open about this, this screen is exactly where that data
 * would plug in.
 *
 * THE FLOW ITSELF, matching what was asked for almost exactly ("pick
 * say common, 8 procreations left, ancestry xyz, and values for the
 * affinities. You get a list and select one then you get a list on the
 * other side of the screen matching."):
 *
 *   STEP 1 - a small, purpose-built filter panel (Rarity, Ancestry,
 *   Procreations Left, and a collapsible Affinities section) narrows
 *   down YOUR OWN Devikins to a pickable list. This is deliberately a
 *   separate, simpler set of controls from FilterPanel.js/
 *   CollectionView.js's own filters - it only ever shows breeding-
 *   relevant columns, filters immediately as you type/pick (no Apply
 *   button - there's no "several changes at once" reason to hold these
 *   back the way the main list's filters do), and Eldritch is never
 *   offered as a Rarity choice since it can't breed. Tapping a result
 *   selects it as your starting Devikin. A "Reset all Step 1 fields"
 *   button sits right under this screen's own top explanation,
 *   visible only while Step 1 is showing, to clear every one of these
 *   fields - including the Target Affinities picker and the Allow
 *   +/-1 toggle below, since both start out as Step 1 picks too - back
 *   to their defaults in one tap.
 *
 *   STEP 2 - once a starting Devikin is selected, a second list shows
 *   every OTHER Devikin in your collection that shares its exact
 *   Rarity, and (by default) its exact Procreations Left too - or a
 *   Procreations Left one off from it either way, if "Allow +/-1" is
 *   toggled on (see rule 2 above and getBreedingCandidates in
 *   src/db/database.js for the actual query and the full eligibility
 *   rules). Matches are sorted with the closest Procreations Left match
 *   first (exact matches before +/-1 ones), then - if one or two Target
 *   Affinities were chosen back in Step 1 - by whichever of those is
 *   WEAKER for that candidate, strongest-first (so a candidate has to
 *   be strong in all of them, not just one, to rank well).
 *   Tapping a match expands a quick side-by-side Affinity comparison
 *   against your selected Devikin, right in place, including the
 *   estimated cost and the offspring's resulting Procreations Left -
 *   just enough to sanity-check a pairing without leaving this screen.
 *   "‹ Step 1" returns to Step 1 without losing your filter picks.
 *
 * This intentionally does NOT build the separate "Compare two NFTs"
 * screen that was asked for alongside this one - that's its own,
 * differently-scoped feature (general-purpose comparison, not specific
 * to breeding) and gets its own design pass.
