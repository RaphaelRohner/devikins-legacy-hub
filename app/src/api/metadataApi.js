/**
 * metadataApi.js
 *
 * Talks to the (unofficial, unreliable) AWS Lambda that serves each NFT's
 * actual traits/stats/image. This is the ONLY source for that information
 * - Klever's own blockchain API never returns game traits, only ownership.
 *
 * Endpoint used:
 *   GET https://1fl8e08843.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/{kind}/{nonce}
 *   e.g. .../devikin/1, .../weapon/100, .../equipment/1
 *
 * This backend is known to be slow and flaky (our own testing found
 * roughly a 1-in-10 chance of any single request timing out or erroring,
 * even for perfectly normal NFTs - see NOTES.md). So this file is built
 * around one central idea: distinguish TWO very different kinds of
 * failure, because they need opposite handling:
 *
 *   1. PERMANENT failure (HTTP 404 - "not found"): this specific NFT has
 *      no metadata record at all. Retrying won't help; it will never
 *      succeed. We return { outcome: 'unavailable' } so the caller can
 *      remember this and never waste time retrying it again.
 *
 *   2. TRANSIENT failure (timeout, HTTP 5xx server errors, dropped
 *      connections): this is the Lambda just being unreliable right now.
 *      The SAME nonce might work fine 30 seconds from now. We retry these
 *      automatically with exponential backoff (waiting 1s, then 2s, then
 *      4s, then 8s between attempts) before finally giving up and
 *      returning { outcome: 'failed' } - which, unlike 'unavailable', WILL
 *      be retried again on a future fetch, since the problem was probably
 *      temporary.
 *
 * A single NFT can take up to about a minute in the worst case (5
 * attempts, each with a 10-second timeout, plus the waits between them) -
 * which is exactly why the optional `shouldCancel` this function accepts
 * matters: without it, tapping "Stop" mid-request would look like it did
 * nothing for up to that long, since nothing would check for a cancel
 * until the current nonce's retry sequence finished on its own. With it,
 * an in-flight request is aborted and any remaining backoff wait is cut
 * short within a fraction of a second of the user tapping Stop.

 *   { outcome: 'failed', error: 'message' } (transient - retries exhausted)

 *
 * `kind` is one of 'devikin' | 'weapon' | 'equipment' (matches the URL
 * segment the Lambda expects, and also our database table names).
 *
 * `shouldCancel` is optional - a function returning true once the user
 * wants to stop (see fetchAllForWallet.js). When provided, it's checked
 * before every attempt, used to abort a request that's already in
 * flight, and used to cut short the wait between retries - see the file
