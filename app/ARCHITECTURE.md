# ARCHITECTURE.md — a plain-English tour of the code

This walks through every file in `app/src/`, in the order you'd want to
read them if you were trying to understand the app for the first time:
data model first, then how data gets fetched, then how it's shown.

If a term here is unfamiliar (SQLite, component, hook...) it's explained
inline the first time it comes up — you shouldn't need outside references.

## The big picture

```
   [You paste a wallet address and tap Fetch]
                    |
                    v
   kleverApi.js  --> asks Klever's blockchain API: "which NFT numbers
                      (nonces) does this wallet hold, per collection?"
                    |
                    v
   metadataApi.js --> for each nonce, asks a separate metadata API:
                      "what are this NFT's name/image/stats?"
                    |
                    v
   fetchAllForWallet.js --> the conductor: runs the above two for all
                      three collections, a few at a time, reports
                      progress, and can be told to stop early
                    |
                    v
   database.js    --> saves each result into a local SQLite database
                      file on your phone (a lightweight database that
                      lives in a single file, no server needed)
                    |
                    v
   App.js + components/*  --> read from that database and display it
                      as three tabs with filters
```

## `src/constants/schema.js` — the single source of truth for "what columns exist"

This file is the one place that says, for each collection, which trait
names map to which database columns, and whether that column holds text
(like a rarity name) or a number (like an attack stat).

Why this matters: instead of the code having "which traits exist" spread
across five different files, everything else in the app (the database
setup, the save logic, the filter dropdowns) reads from this one file. If
the game ever adds a new trait we want a real column for, this is the only
file that needs a new line added.

It also solves a real quirk we found: weapons call one of their traits
`"ImprovementLevel"` (no space) while equipment calls the same concept
`"Improvement Level"` (with a space). This file maps both spellings to one
shared `improvement_level` column, so the app treats them as the same
thing rather than as two unrelated traits.

## `src/db/database.js` — everything that talks to the local database

Key functions, in the order you'd use them:

- **`initDatabase()`** — runs once when the app starts. Creates the three
  NFT tables (`devikin`, `weapon`, `equipment`) if they don't already
  exist, with columns built from `schema.js`, plus a `wallets` table (see
  below) and a generic `settings` table. Also runs small one-time
  migrations for columns/tables added after the app was already in use
  on a real phone (`ensureColumn`, and the wallets-migration described
  under "Multiple wallets" below) — these are safe to run every time the
  app starts, since they no-op once already applied.
- **`getExistingStatuses(kind, nonces)`** — before re-fetching, checks
  which nonces we already have and what state they're in (see `status`
  below), so we don't waste time re-fetching NFTs we already know are
  permanently unavailable.
- **`upsertNft(kind, {...})`** — saves one NFT's data. This is where the
  "flatten traits into columns" logic lives: it looks at each
  `trait_type` in the fetched data, finds the matching column via
  `schema.js`, and writes the value there. Any trait it doesn't recognize
  gets logged (printed) rather than silently thrown away — that's your
  signal, if you're watching the Terminal during a fetch, that the game
  added something new worth adding a real column for. Either way, the
  *entire* raw response is also always saved in a `raw_json` column, so
  nothing is ever truly lost even before a column exists for it.
  **Bug fix (found while building V2):** this writes with `INSERT OR
  REPLACE`, which for a `nonce` conflict deletes the old row and inserts
  a fresh one — any column not explicitly listed in that INSERT silently
  resets to its default. `custom_name`/`star_rating` (V2's new columns)
  are local, user-entered data the metadata API never sends back, so
  without reading them first and re-including them in every INSERT,
  simply tapping Fetch/Update would have quietly wiped every custom name
  and star rating on the very first re-fetch. `upsertNft` now reads
  those two columns' current values before writing and carries them
  forward every time. **`deleted`/`comment` are deliberately NOT given
  this treatment** — see "Marking NFTs as deleted" in NOTES.md, which
  explains why letting those two reset on a successful re-fetch is the
  intended behavior, not a bug, and says explicitly not to change it.
- **`queryNfts(kind, ownerAddresses, filters, excludeDeleted, searchText, starRating)`**
  — builds and runs the actual `SELECT` query for what to show on screen,
  based on whatever filters are currently active. `ownerAddresses` is an
  array (matched with a SQL `IN (...)`) since the app can track more than
  one wallet now — see "Multiple wallets" below. `excludeDeleted` is the
  "Deleted" switch next to the filter toggle. `searchText` (V2) is the
  top search bar in `App.js` — matches `name`, `custom_name`, or the
  nonce itself, case-insensitively. `starRating` (V2) is the Filters
  panel's 1-5 star Rating filter — an **exact** rating match ("only my
  4-star items"), not "4 or better", regardless of how many stars light
  up on screen (see `StarRating.js` below).
- **`getDistinctColumnValues` / `getColumnRange`** — used by the filter
  panel to figure out, from the data actually in the database, what
  dropdown options or min/max ranges to offer (see FilterPanel.js below).
  Also take `ownerAddresses` as an array now, for the same reason.
- **`getWallets` / `addWallet` / `updateWalletAddress` / `deleteWallet`**
  — plain CRUD over the `wallets` table, used by `WalletManager.js`.
  `deleteWallet` only removes the wallet from this list — it does not
  touch any NFT rows already saved under that address. `wallets` also
  has an optional `alias` column (a friendly name like "Main") that
  `updateWalletAddress(id, address, alias)` writes alongside the
  address — an empty/blank alias is stored as `NULL`, not `''`.
- **`setNftDeletedState(kind, nonce, deleted, comment)`** — the one
  function behind both "Mark as Deleted" and "Restore" in `NftCard.js`
  (just called with `deleted` true or false) — writes the `deleted` flag
  and `comment` columns for one NFT.
- **`setNftCustomName(kind, nonce, customName)`** / **`setNftStarRating(kind, nonce, starRating)`**
  (V2) — write the `custom_name` and `star_rating` columns for one NFT,
  behind the Name & Rating section in `NftCard.js`'s detail view. Both
  are entirely local/user-entered — the metadata API never touches
  either column.
- **`resetAllData()`** — empties the `devikin`, `weapon`, `equipment`,
  and `wallets` tables (not dropping them, just clearing every row).
  Powers the "Reset All Data" button in `WalletManager.js`; paired
  there with `deleteAllStoredImages()` in `imageStorage.js`, which
  deletes the whole downloaded-images folder the same way.
- **`countNfts(kind, ownerAddresses, excludeDeleted)`** — just a `COUNT(*)`
  version of `queryNfts` (same `ownerAddresses` array/`excludeDeleted`
  handling, no filters). Powers the "142 Devikins"-style active-item
  count shown next to "Show filters" in `CollectionView.js`.

### The `status` column, explained

Every saved NFT has a status of `ok`, `unavailable`, or `failed`:

- `ok` — fetched fine, full data present.
- `unavailable` — the metadata API cleanly said "this doesn't exist" (a
  404 error). This is treated as a permanent, trustworthy answer, so
  future fetches skip re-asking about it.
- `failed` — something temporary went wrong (a timeout, a server error)
  after using up all retry attempts. Unlike `unavailable`, these ARE
  retried on your next fetch, because the problem was probably the
  metadata API just being flaky that one time, not the NFT actually
  missing.

### Multiple wallets

The `wallets` table (`id`, `address`, `created_at`) is the source of
truth for which addresses the app fetches from and shows NFTs for -
`App.js` loads it once on startup and again after every change made in
`WalletManager.js`, and passes the plain address list down to
`CollectionView.js` as `ownerAddresses`. Every query that used to match
`owner_address = ?` now matches `owner_address IN (...)` against that
whole list instead (see `ownerAddressClause` in `database.js`, a small
shared helper every multi-wallet query function uses).

Fetching stays sequential across wallets rather than parallel - see
`fetchAllForWallets` in `fetchAllForWallet.js` below - for the same
"don't hammer an already-flaky server" reasoning that limits
per-collection fetches to `CONCURRENCY` requests at a time.

One migration detail worth knowing: before this feature existed, the app
only ever remembered a single address (in the `settings` table, under
`lastWalletAddress`). `initDatabase()` carries that address over into the
new `wallets` table automatically, exactly once, the first time the app
opens after this update - otherwise upgrading would make already-fetched
NFT data seem to disappear (it's still in the `devikin`/`weapon`/
`equipment` tables, just with nothing in `wallets` to match it against).

## `src/api/kleverApi.js` — "which NFTs does this wallet hold?"

One function: `fetchWalletNonces(walletAddress, collectionId)`. Calls
Klever's own blockchain API, page by page, and keeps going until a page
comes back with fewer items than we asked for (meaning we've hit the end).
It deliberately does **not** trust the API's own "how many pages are
there" field — during testing we found that field lies at high page sizes,
so the code checks the actual number of items returned each time instead.

## `src/api/metadataApi.js` — "what are this NFT's stats?"

One function: `fetchNftMetadata(kind, nonce)`. This is the file with the
retry logic, since the metadata API (a third-party service, not something
we control) is known to be slow and occasionally fails outright.

- Each request gets a 10-second timeout.
- If a request times out or the server errors, it's retried up to 4 times
  with increasing waits between attempts (1 second, then 2, then 4, then
  8) — this is called "exponential backoff," and it's the standard way to
  be a polite, resilient client to a flaky API without hammering it.
- If the server instead cleanly says "not found" (404), it does **not**
  retry — that's a real, permanent answer, not a fluke.
- This function never throws an error out to whoever called it; it always
  returns a plain description of what happened (`ok` / `unavailable` /
  `failed`), which is what makes it safe for one bad NFT to never crash
  the whole fetch.

## `src/api/fetchAllForWallet.js` — the conductor

The core function is `fetchAllForWallet(walletAddress, {onProgress, shouldCancel})`,
which ties the two API files together for all three collections, for ONE
wallet address:

1. For each collection, get the full list of nonces the wallet holds
   (via `kleverApi.js`).
2. Skip any nonce already marked `unavailable` from a previous run.
3. Fetch the rest, **4 at a time** (not all at once, and not one at a
   time) — a middle ground that's much faster than doing them
   sequentially, but gentle enough not to overwhelm the metadata API.
4. After every single NFT finishes (success or failure), calls the
   `onProgress` callback so the screen can update its progress bar, and
   checks `shouldCancel()` so it can stop promptly if you tap "Stop".

`fetchAllForWallets(walletAddresses, {onProgress, shouldCancel})` (note
the extra "s") is the multi-wallet wrapper around that - it loops over
every saved wallet address, sequentially, calling `fetchAllForWallet` for
each one and tagging every progress update with `walletAddress`/
`walletIndex`/`walletTotal` so the UI can show which wallet is currently
being worked on (see `ProgressBar.js`). This is the function `App.js`
actually calls when you tap "Fetch/Update".

`retryPendingItems`/`retryPendingItemsForWallets` follow the exact same
single-wallet/multi-wallet pairing. They used to be driven by a
background auto-retry timer in `App.js` that ran on its own every
minute; that timer was removed (per feedback that nothing should fetch
over the network unless Fetch/Update is actually tapped - see NOTES.md),
so these two functions are currently unused, kept in place rather than
deleted in case a manual "retry failed items" action is ever added back
as its own explicit button.

## The UI files

The app deliberately does **not** use a navigation library (like React
Navigation, which many RN apps use) — for an app with just three tabs and
no back-and-forth screen stack, plain state (`useState`, a basic React
tool for "remember which thing is currently selected") is simpler to
follow than adding a whole extra library and its concepts on top. One
thing that choice doesn't give you for free, though, is Android's
system Back button/gesture knowing to close the current "screen" first
— so both `App.js` and `CollectionView.js` each register their own
`BackHandler` listener (React Native's API for the hardware/gesture
Back action) to fill in that one specific gap; see each file's own
notes below.

- **`App.js`** — the root screen. Owns the saved wallet list (loaded from
  the database, refreshed after any change made in `WalletManager.js`),
  the in-progress fetch's state (so it can show a progress bar and a Stop
  button), and — as of V2 — a single `currentScreen` value naming
  whichever screen is showing (`'devikin'`/`'weapon'`/`'equipment'`,
  `'wallets'`, or `'feedback'`), replacing the old pair of separate
  `activeKind`/`showWalletManager` flags now that a fourth,
  non-collection screen (Feedback) exists too. **V2 navigation redesign:**
  the old always-visible Fetch/Update + Wallets buttons and the
  Devikins/Weapons/Equipment tab row are gone — all six of those actions
  now live inside `HamburgerMenu.js`, opened by a ☰ button on the top
  row's left, with the light/dark theme toggle on that same row's right
  (per feedback, this row moved above the search row below it, and the
  toggle moved onto it from the search row - both used to be laid out
  the other way around). Underneath that sits a persistent search bar
  (search by name/ID) — see `CollectionView.js` below for how the
  search text feeds into `queryNfts`. The exact-match 1-5 star filter
  (`StarRating.js`) used to sit in this same top area; it's since moved
  down into `FilterPanel.js`, alongside the other filters.
  Both Wallets and Feedback still take over the whole screen exactly as
  Wallets always did, with their own "‹ Back to Home" button that
  returns to whichever collection screen (`lastCollectionScreen`) was
  showing before they were opened. A `BackHandler` listener closes the
  hamburger menu first if it's open, then falls back to that same
  "return to the last collection screen" behavior for Wallets/Feedback,
  and otherwise lets Android do its normal thing. Everything else is
  broken out into smaller files below.

- **`components/WalletManager.js`** — the "Wallets" screen, opened from
  the hamburger menu (V2 moved it out of a dedicated top-of-screen
  button; the screen itself is unchanged). Plain CRUD over the `wallets`
  database table: paste an
  address and tap Add; Edit/Save/Cancel an existing one inline; Delete
  one (no confirmation dialog, to match the rest of the app's plain
  style - see its own file comment for why that's low-risk). Editing a
  wallet also shows a second, optional field for naming it (e.g.
  "Main", "Trading") - once saved, that name shows up on the row to the
  right of the Edit/Delete buttons, so wallets are easier to tell apart
  than by their raw address alone. The very first wallet you ever add
  (only that one - not any added afterward) triggers a one-time popup
  reminding you that the first Fetch/Update will take a few minutes,
  since nothing's cached yet (see `handleAdd`). A "Danger zone" section
  below the wallet list has a confirmation-gated "Reset All Data"
  button (`handleResetAllData`) that empties every wallet, every saved
  NFT, and every downloaded image - back to exactly a fresh install -
  mainly there as a testing convenience. Takes over the whole content
  area the same way an NFT's detail view does in `CollectionView.js`,
  with its own "‹ Back to Home" button - this app still isn't using a
  navigation library (see above), it's the same "swap what's rendered
  based on a flag" pattern throughout.

- **`components/TabBar.js`** — **superseded by V2's hamburger menu** (see
  `HamburgerMenu.js` below) and no longer imported anywhere. Left in the
  repo rather than deleted, in case the old always-visible tab row look
  is ever wanted back.

- **`components/HamburgerMenu.js`** (V2) — the full-screen menu opened by
  `App.js`'s ☰ button, replacing the old tab row plus the Fetch/Update
  and Wallets buttons. A plain full-screen `Modal` (the same component
  `NftCard.js` uses for its fullscreen image viewer) listing seven
  entries: Wallets (with a live wallet count), Fetch/Update (an action,
  not a screen — it closes the menu and starts a scan without changing
  what's showing), then Devikins/Weapons/Equipment/Feedback/Ask Devi
  (each just sets `App.js`'s `currentScreen`). The entry matching the
  currently-showing collection screen is outlined to show where you are.

- **`components/StarRating.js`** (V2) — a shared row of five tappable ★
  stars used in two places: `FilterPanel.js`'s Rating filter, and the
  Rating control in `NftCard.js`'s detail view. Visually both light up
  every star from 1 up to the current value together (tapping star 3
  lights up 1, 2, and 3), the usual five-star-widget look — per
  feedback that the filter lighting only the single tapped star read as
  inconsistent with the detail view. That's purely display: the filter
  is still an **exact** match ("show me only my 3-star items"), not a
  minimum — that logic lives in `queryNfts`'s `star_rating = ?` query,
  not in this component. Tapping the already-selected star clears the
  pick back to 0/unrated, either way.

- **`components/ProgressBar.js`** — shown only while a fetch is running.
  Displays which collection is currently being fetched and a count like
  "12 of 47", plus the Stop button.

- **`components/CollectionView.js`** — the main content area for one tab.
  Combines the filter controls and the list of NFT cards/rows, across
  every saved wallet at once (`ownerAddresses` - see "Multiple wallets"
  above). Handles three different "nothing to show" situations
  distinctly, so you always know *why* the list is empty:
  1. No wallet has been added yet.
  2. You fetched, and none of your wallets hold anything in this
     collection (not an error — some wallets just don't have any
     equipment, for example).
  3. There are NFTs in this collection, but the search text, star
     Rating, and/or trait filters (`hasActiveFilters`) exclude all of
     them - per feedback that once the collection tabs moved inside the
     hamburger menu, a bare "No NFTs match these filters" no longer
     said which tab you were even on. The message now names both (e.g.
     "No Weapons match the filters: Rarity: Common, Rating: 4 stars") -
     see `describeActiveFilters`/`emptyStateMessage` in this file for
     how that list gets built (and how "filter" vs "filters" picks
     itself based on the count - "the filter(s)" read wrong per
     feedback), using `FilterPanel.js`'s own `humanizeColumnName` so the
     wording matches the filter rows themselves. Deliberately drops
     "NFTs" after the collection name (e.g. "No Weapons match...", not
     "No Weapons NFTs match...") - a plural noun awkwardly modifying
     another noun, also per feedback. The Deleted switch isn't counted
     as a "filter" for this - narrowing the list to nothing purely by
     excluding deleted items falls back to situation
     2's wording instead.

  It also owns the list/detail switch, driven by the
  `SUMMARY_ROW_COMPONENTS` lookup at the top of the file - every
  collection (Devikins, Weapons, Equipment) now has an entry there.
  Tapping a summary row in the list sets a `selectedNonce`, which swaps
  the whole view to that item's full `NftCard` instead, with a centred
  "‹ Back to Home" link to return. This resets back to the list automatically if you
  switch tabs or fetch a different wallet. A `BackHandler` listener
  makes Android's system Back action do the same thing as that link
  whenever a detail view is open (`isDetailViewOpen`), and otherwise
  lets Android do its normal thing - see the file comment above "The UI
  files" for why this exists at all. Adding this treatment to any
  future new collection just means writing its own `<Kind>SummaryRow.js`
  (following `DevikinSummaryRow.js`, `WeaponSummaryRow.js`, or
  `EquipmentSummaryRow.js` as a template) and adding one line to
  `SUMMARY_ROW_COMPONENTS`.

  This file also owns *all* of the filtering state now - which options
  are available (asked from the database, same data-driven approach
  described under FilterPanel.js below), what's picked but not yet
  applied (`pendingFilters`), and what's actually been applied
  (`appliedFilters`). It renders the "Show filters"/"Hide filters"
  toggle and the filter buttons itself, as a plain sibling directly
  above the results `FlatList` - never inside it - so that bar is
  genuinely pinned in place and can never be scrolled out of view, no
  matter how many filter rows there are or how far down the list you
  scroll.

  The toggle row itself is a two-sided row: "Show filters"/"Hide
  filters" on the left, and on the right, always visible, the
  **Deleted** switch (off by default - see "Marking NFTs as deleted"
  below) plus, only once `hasAppliedFilters` is true, a small "Remove
  filters ✕" link - so an active filter selection can be cleared in one
  tap without expanding the panel at all. Between those two sides sits a
  small active-item count (e.g. "142 Devikins"), backed by `countNfts`
  in `database.js` - it always counts with deleted items excluded,
  independent of both the Deleted switch and any applied filters, since
  it's meant to answer "how many active items exist here" rather than
  "how many rows currently match". Below that row, "Apply
  Filters" only appears while the panel is expanded *and* there's a
  new, not-yet-applied pick waiting (`hasPendingChanges`) - there's
  nothing to show otherwise. Tapping either button re-queries the list
  *and* collapses the filter rows panel closed again, so picking or
  clearing a filter tidies the screen back up rather than leaving a
  long list of rows open. The Deleted switch itself re-queries
  immediately on toggle (it isn't part of the pending/applied two-step
  dance the trait filters use) since there's no "controls" to fiddle
  with first - it's a single on/off choice.

  **V2 additions:** this file now also accepts `searchText`/`starFilter`/
  `onStarFilterChange`/`viewMode` props from `App.js` and passes
  `searchText` straight through to `queryNfts`, alongside its own trait
  `filters`. `searchText` deliberately does NOT get reset by the
  kind-change effect above, since carrying a search across tabs (search
  "123", then check another collection) is the expected behavior, not a
  bug. `starFilter` (the applied value) carries over the same way - but
  unlike `searchText`, it now goes through its own local
  `pendingStarFilter` state first (mirroring `pendingFilters` below) so
  a star pick joins the same Apply Filters step the trait filters use,
  rather than narrowing the list the instant a star is tapped like it
  used to; `pendingStarFilter` DOES get reset by the kind-change effect
  (back to whatever `starFilter` is still applied, not to 0) so an
  unapplied pick doesn't silently carry into another tab. See this
  file's own file comment and `FilterPanel.js`'s notes below for the
  full reasoning. **List/Tiles**
  (`viewMode`) used to be state this file owned itself, with its own
  toggle row; per feedback moving that toggle up onto `App.js`'s search
  row (to the right of the search field), the state moved up too -
  `App.js` now owns it (persisted via `getSetting`/`setSetting` in
  `database.js` so it doesn't reset on app restart) and this file just
  receives the current value as a plain prop, read-only from here. Still
  ONE shared choice across Devikins/Weapons/Equipment either way. Tiles
  mode renders `NftTile.js` in a 3-column grid via the `FlatList`'s
  `numColumns` prop instead of the usual full-width summary rows. Since
  React Native doesn't support changing `numColumns` on an already-
  mounted `FlatList`, the list is `key`-ed by `viewMode` so toggling
  forces a fresh remount rather than an error.

- **`components/FilterPanel.js`** — just the dropdowns and range boxes
  themselves (no toggle, no Apply/Remove button - those live in
  `CollectionView.js`, see above), plus one extra row of its own at the
  top: the exact-match 1-5 star **Rating** filter (`StarRating.js`) -
  unlike every row below it, this one isn't derived from the database
  (its options are just a fixed row of 5 stars), but it IS part of the
  same pending/Apply flow those rows use: the `starFilter`/
  `onStarFilterChange` props passed in here are `CollectionView.js`'s
  own `pendingStarFilter`/`setPendingStarFilter`, not the applied value
  straight from `App.js`, so tapping a star only updates the pending
  pick until Apply Filters is pressed (per feedback that having the
  star narrow the list instantly, while every other filter waited for
  Apply, was confusing - see that file's own V2-additions note above
  for the full reasoning). `CollectionView.js`
  places this whole component inside its `FlatList`'s
  `ListHeaderComponent`, and only
  while the panel is expanded, so these rows scroll together with the
  results underneath them (this is also what fixes an earlier bug where
  a long list of expanded filters — 20+ for Devikins — could grow taller
  than the screen with nothing below it reachable by scrolling).

  **Devikins' filters are grouped (V2), per feedback that the flat list
  of all 21 was too long to scan.** `GROUPS_BY_KIND` (this file) maps
  `kind` to a group definition — currently just `devikin:
  DEVIKIN_FILTER_GROUPS` (schema.js) — and a kind with no entry (weapon/
  equipment, for now) falls back to `[]`, i.e. the original flat list,
  unchanged. For Devikins: Rarity/Ancestry/Personality/Life Stage/
  Procreations Left stay always visible right below Rating (they're
  simply whatever's left in `TRAIT_COLUMNS.devikin` once the grouped
  columns are excluded — see `alwaysVisibleColumnNames`), and the
  remaining 16 collapse into three tappable sections — **Genes** (the
  five *_gene columns), **Affinities** (Overall + the five element
  Affinities), **Attributes** (the five element Attributes) — each
  closed by default. `expandedGroups` (which sections are open) is
  local `useState` inside `FilterPanel.js` itself, not lifted up to
  `CollectionView.js` like the actual filter picks are - it's a pure
  display choice, not part of what gets applied, so it's fine for it to
  reset to fully-collapsed every time this component remounts (i.e.
  every time the whole panel is hidden and shown again via
  `CollectionView.js`'s own "Show/Hide filters" toggle). A group with
  none of its columns present in this wallet's `availableOptions` (e.g.
  every Devikin happens to be missing one gene) doesn't render at all,
  same rule the flat list always used per-column.

  The available options are still data-driven rather than hardcoded:
  `CollectionView.js` asks the database (via `getDistinctColumnValues`/
  `getColumnRange`) what values and ranges actually exist *for this
  specific wallet's data* and passes the result down as a prop — so if
  your wallet's NFTs only ever have 3 of the 8 possible rarities, you'll
  only see those 3 as filter options, not a bunch of dead options that
  would always return nothing.

  One deliberate detail: the numeric range boxes intentionally use the
  regular keyboard, not the phone's "numeric" keypad. iOS's numeric
  keypad has no minus-sign key, and two real traits here (Speed Modifier,
  Accuracy) can be negative — so a numeric-only keypad would make it
  impossible to type "-5" as a filter bound.

- **`components/DevikinSummaryRow.js`** — the compact, tappable row shown
  for each Devikin in the Devikins tab's list: the picture, its ID
  (`#<nonce>`, always shown), then Rarity/Ancestry/Personality, stacked.
  Tapping it is what opens the full detail view (see CollectionView.js
  above). Greyed out (`opacity: 0.45`) with a small "Deleted" tag when
  `nft.deleted` is set - still tappable, so you can open it and hit
  Restore. If `nft.custom_name` is set, it also shows as a small pill
  pinned to the row's top-right corner (`customNameBadge`) - per
  feedback that a nickname should be visible from the overview list,
  not just once you've opened the item's detail view.

- **`components/WeaponSummaryRow.js`** — the same idea for the Weapons
  tab: picture on the left, its ID then Rarity/Type/Quality stacked on
  the right. Tapping it opens that weapon's full `NftCard` detail view.
  Same greyed-out/"Deleted" tag treatment, and the same top-right
  custom-name badge, as DevikinSummaryRow.js above.

- **`components/EquipmentSummaryRow.js`** — the same idea again for the
  Equipment tab: picture on the left, its ID then Rarity/Type/Quality
  stacked on the right (a first-pass field choice, expected to be
  revisited). Tapping it opens that item's full `NftCard` detail view.
  Same greyed-out/"Deleted" tag treatment, and the same top-right
  custom-name badge, as the other two summary rows.

- **`components/NftCard.js`** — one NFT's full detail view: its image (or
  a placeholder if the image is missing or the NFT's status isn't `ok`),
  its name, its nonce number, a status badge (only shown when the status
  *isn't* `ok`, since that's the unusual case), and its trait values. All
  three collections are now only reachable by tapping their own summary
  row (see above), and each gets its own hand-arranged layout, described
  in full in NOTES.md:
  - Devikins: ID/Procreations Left/Life Stage/Overall Affinity, then
    Rarity/Ancestry/Personality, then the five gene traits, then the
    five Affinity/Attribute pairs, then anything left over.
  - Weapons: Name/nonce, then Rarity/Type/Quality, then
    Shiny/Slot/Element/Resistance Type/Gene Sync as chips, then the five
    combat stats two-per-row, then Base Durability/Durability/Improvement
    Level, then anything left over.
  - Equipment: Name/nonce, then Rarity/Type/Quality, then
    Shiny/Slot/Resistance Type as chips, then Protection/Evasion/
    Guard/Resistance two-per-row, then Accuracy/Improvement Level/
    Refine XP, then anything left over. A first pass - the user has said
    they'll want to revisit the exact field choices here.
  A generic image-left/chips-below layout still exists as a fallback in
  the code for any future new collection that hasn't gotten a custom
  layout yet, but nothing currently uses it.

  Every one of these layouts ends the same way now: a **Name & Rating**
  section (V2 - added ahead of Notes/Delete, per how this was designed),
  then a **Notes** box (a free-text comment, saved to the `comment`
  column) and a **Mark as Deleted** button (flips the `deleted` column
  and closes the loop by calling `onNftUpdated` - a callback
  `CollectionView.js` passes in as `reloadRows`, so the list picks up
  the change immediately). Once deleted, that same button becomes
  **Restore**. This is a soft, reversible, purely-local flag - see
  NOTES.md's "Marking NFTs as deleted" section for the full reasoning.

  **Name & Rating (V2):** an editable nickname (saved to the
  `custom_name` column via `setNftCustomName`) - separate from `name`,
  the in-game name pulled from fetched metadata, which is never
  hand-edited - and a 1-5 star rating (`StarRating.js`, saved to
  `star_rating` via `setNftStarRating` the instant a star is tapped -
  no separate save step needed, since picking a rating IS the action).
  The nickname works differently: nothing is written to the database
  just from typing or leaving the field - a **Save Name** button right
  below the field (greyed out/disabled whenever the typed draft matches
  what's already saved) is the only thing that actually commits it, per
  feedback that nothing should save itself without an explicit tap.
  Clearing a rating back to "not rated" always worked by tapping the
  currently-lit star again (`StarRating.js`'s own toggle-to-0 behavior),
  but per feedback that wasn't discoverable as an actual "un-rate"
  option - a **Clear Rating** button now appears right below the stars
  whenever `nft.star_rating` is set, calling the exact same
  `handleStarRatingChange(0)` the repeat-tap already used. Both name
  and rating are searchable/filterable - the name from the top search
  bar in `App.js`, the rating from the Rating row in `FilterPanel.js`
  (see above) - via `queryNfts`'s `searchText`/`starRating` parameters.

- **`components/NftTile.js`** (V2) — the compact square tile shown for
  each NFT in "Tiles" view (see `App.js`'s List/Tiles toggle, passed
  down through `CollectionView.js`'s `viewMode` prop): just the picture
  and its ID, greyed out with a "Deleted" tag the same way the summary
  rows are - deliberately minimal, since the whole point of a grid view
  is fitting more on screen at a glance. One exception, same as the
  summary rows: a custom nickname, if set, shows as a small pill pinned
  to the tile's own top-right corner. Tapping one opens the same full
  `NftCard` detail view "List" view does.

- **`components/Feedback.js`** (V2) — the "Feedback" screen, the sixth
  hamburger menu entry. Builds a `mailto:` link and opens it via React
  Native's `Linking.openURL()` - the player still has to tap Send
  themselves in whatever email app opens, since this app has no backend
  of its own to send anything on their behalf. The subject line carries
  the app name, version, and category (Feature request/Bug
  report/Feedback); the body, per feedback, always follows one fixed
  order regardless of category: the app name and version, the sender's
  own email address (a new optional field, so Raphael has a way to
  reply - else "(not provided)"), the feedback type, the name (if
  given, else "(not provided)"), then the free-text message itself.
  The draft itself is always addressed to `chibitales2@gmail.com` - a
  separate Gmail address Raphael already owns from an older game
  project, not a GitHub address (GitHub's own commit-attribution
  noreply addresses are outbound-only and can't actually forward
  anything inbound). This used to be a "+" alias of Raphael's own
  primary Gmail address instead (mail to you+anything@gmail.com lands
  straight in your normal inbox, no separate mailbox needed - it
  worked fine), but per feedback he'd rather not have his primary
  personal address sitting in the app's source at all, so it moved to
  this separate address instead; the sender's own email in the body is
  separate from this and purely informational. If no email app is
  available, falls back to an alert showing the feedback address and
  the full message text to copy by hand.

- **`components/HelpAssistant.js`** ("Devi", V2) — a small, entirely
  offline, explicitly-not-a-real-AI helper, added on request for "a
  downgraded version of you" in the app - and kept that way on purpose
  even after later being asked to "make it AI", since a real AI chat
  needs its own API key and a backend server to hold it safely, plus
  real per-message cost, which is a genuinely different, bigger project
  (see NOTES.md). A chat-shaped screen (the seventh hamburger menu
  entry) whose every `FAQ_ENTRIES` question/answer pair is always shown
  as a plain stacked list (not hidden behind tappable chips), covering
  using this app - adding a wallet, what Fetch/Update does, filters,
  List/Tiles, naming/rating an NFT, sending feedback, the Deleted
  behavior, resetting data, the (now removed) automatic retry, the
  theme toggle, multiple wallets, and "who are you" - plus a text input
  at the bottom for typing your own question, which gets its own
  matched answer appended as a small chat exchange above the list.
  Matching (`matchEntry`/`scoreEntry`) is still just keyword scoring, no
  language model, no network call, no API key, nothing that costs
  money - but a bit smarter than plain substring matching: `editDistance`
  gives it some typo tolerance ("walet" still finds the wallet answer)
  and simple prefix matching, on top of the original exact-keyword
  scoring. Says so itself, in its own greeting and whenever nothing
  matches (`FALLBACK_ANSWER`) - it should never seem more capable than
  it is.

## KLV Signer (test): signing through a separate app (added in 4.1.0)

The Hub never holds a wallet's private key. To *send* something on the
Klever chain, it asks the separate **KLV Signer** app (its own project,
`Documents/KLV Signer App`), which shows the user the transaction, asks for
the Signer's password and signs. Testnet only for now.

- `src/components/SignerTestView.js`: the "KLV Signer (test)" screen
  (menu → KLV Signer (test)). Connect, show testnet balance, send.
- `src/api/klvSigner.js`: asks the Signer (`getSignerAddress`,
  `signWithSigner`) using Android's "start activity for result" via
  `expo-intent-launcher`. Answers are "ok" with values, or an Error with a
  plain-English message and a `code` (e.g. `USER_REJECTED`, `NOT_INSTALLED`).
  The rules are the Signer project's `SIGNER-PROTOCOL.md`.
- `src/api/kleverTx.js`: `buildTransfer` (a Klever testnet node prepares the
  unsigned transaction), `broadcastSigned`, `getKlvBalance`, `klvToUnits`
  (exact, 6 decimals), `explorerUrl`.
- `plugins/withKlvSigner.js`: config plugin adding the Signer to the
  manifest's `<queries>` (Android 11+ package visibility).
- `modules/klv-signer-check/` (4.1.1): the Hub's only native code, a tiny
  local Expo module. `signerStatus()` asks Android whether the app installed
  as the Signer carries the official Signer seal (signing certificate).
  `klvSigner.js` calls it (`verifySigner`) before every request and refuses
  to send anything to a Signer with another seal (`SIGNER_NOT_OFFICIAL`) or
  when the check can't run (`SIGNER_CHECK_FAILED`). Expo links it
  automatically because it sits in `modules/`.
- (4.1.2) `signWithSigner` checks the Signer's answer with `signedMatches`:
  the signed transaction must be exactly the unsigned one the Hub prepared
  plus the 64-byte signature, or nothing is sent (`SIGNED_MISMATCH`).

## Where the traits actually came from

The exact list of every trait we found per collection, with min/max
ranges for numbers and all the possible values for categories, is saved
as a doc in the claude.ai project for this app (`devikins-trait-survey.md`),
not duplicated here — `schema.js` is the code's reflection of that
research, so if you want the full original findings, that's where to look.
