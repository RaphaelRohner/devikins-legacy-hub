/**
 * App.js
 *
 * The root of the whole app. This is the file Expo runs first. It's
 * responsible for:
 *
 *   - Wrapping everything in a ThemeProvider, so light/dark mode is
 *     available to every screen (see src/context/ThemeContext.js).
 *   - Setting up the local database once, when the app starts.
 *   - Rendering the persistent top bar shown above the Devikins/
 *     Weapons/Equipment screens: a top row with the ☰ hamburger button
 *     on the left (opens HamburgerMenu.js, a full-screen menu that
 *     replaced the old tab bar and the old Fetch/Update + Wallets
 *     buttons that used to sit at the top of the screen) and the
 *     light/dark theme toggle on the right, then the search field on
 *     its own row underneath. The exact-match star-rating filter
 *     (StarRating.js) that
 *     used to live in this top bar now lives inside each collection's
 *     own Filters panel instead (FilterPanel.js), alongside the other
 *     trait filters. See HamburgerMenu.js's own file
 *     comment for the six menu entries and what each one does.
 *   - Kicking off fetchAllForWallets.js when Fetch/Update is tapped (now
 *     from inside the menu), and tracking its progress/cancellation.
 *     This is the ONLY way a fetch ever runs - there's no automatic
 *     background fetching/retrying of any kind; nothing happens over
 *     the network unless you tap Fetch/Update yourself.
 *   - Deciding which "screen" is currently showing: one of the three
 *     collection kinds (devikin/weapon/equipment), the Wallets
 *     management screen, or the Feedback form - see `currentScreen`
 *     below.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT using a navigation library (like React Navigation) -
 * everything here is just plain React state (useState) deciding what to
 * render. For an app this size, that's simpler to follow than adding a
 * whole navigation system on top. `currentScreen` plays the same role a
 * router's "current route" would.
 *
 * V2 note: TabBar.js (the old Devikins/Weapons/Equipment tab row) is no
 * longer used - switching between those three is now done from inside
 * HamburgerMenu.js instead, per the V2 navigation redesign. The file is
 * left in place rather than deleted, in case you'd ever want the old
 * tab-row look back.

  //      anything left unfinished (failed items, or items missing a
  //      cached image) and quietly retries just those - see
  //      retryPendingItemsForWallets in fetchAllForWallet.js. Fast (once
  //      a minute) for the first MAX_AUTO_RETRY_ROUNDS rounds after
  //      anything triggers it, then backs off to slow (once an hour) -
  //      see the AUTO_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS/MAX_AUTO_RETRY_ROUNDS/
  //      SLOW_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS comment above for the reasoning. This is
  //      what fixes "some items stayed failed/imageless after the last
  //      Fetch" without the user having to keep tapping Fetch by hand.
  //      Per feedback, this same check also runs immediately (not just
  //      on the timer's own pace) right when the app opens and every
  //      time it comes back to the foreground - see the AppState
  //      listener below - so anything left over is already being fixed
  //      by the time you're looking at the screen, not just eventually.
  //      The check itself (countPendingRetries) is a cheap local
  //      database read, so triggering it often costs nothing extra when
  //      there's nothing actually wrong - it only escalates to real
  //      network requests when there's something to retry.
  //
  //   2. Image-freshness check: on its own separate, plain hourly
  //      cadence (nextFreshnessCheckAtRef/IMAGE_FRESHNESS_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS,
  //      independent of whatever pace #1 is currently at), asks whether
  //      Moonlabs has corrected any already-downloaded picture - see

  //      needs catching up on the moment you look at the screen.

  // numbers - the two literally swap places in this same
  // inlineProgressWrapper slot depending on isFetching/isRetrying (see
  // the JSX above), so matching ProgressBar's own explicit height (its
  // own comment there: "matches the hamburger button's own height
  // exactly") is what actually guarantees this chip, the progress bar,
  // and the hamburger/theme-toggle buttons flanking this row all line
  // up, the same way padding-matching alone didn't reliably hold
  // elsewhere in this app (see sortButton's own comment on the
  // arrow-glyph line-height issue). No explicit width, same as
  // ProgressBar's own container - it fills inlineProgressWrapper's
  // full flex:1 width by default rather than sizing to its own content
  // (per feedback wanting this to match the search field's own width,
  // which fills its wrapper the exact same way one row down).

  // Explicit width (rather than sizing to its own icon+label content,

  // wider - same explicit-shared-number approach as searchInput/
  // sortButton/filtersToggleButton's own height match above, and for
  // the same reason: matching padding numbers alone doesn't guarantee
  // matching sizes once the actual content differs (an icon + word here
  // vs. just a word there). filtersToggleButtonText/themeToggleLabel
  // both got a numberOfLines/ellipsizeMode safety net in the JSX, in
